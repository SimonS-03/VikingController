# VikingController
Contains the code for our (team SwedishVikings) AI agent submission in the 2025 Explainable Fuzzy Challenge.

The controller is contained in the folder VikingAgent, within the files "RunOrShootController.py" or "RunOrShootControllerEXPLANATIONS.py" to play with or without explanations.
If you want to run the game directly from the files of this repo, run the file "combinedScenario.py".

Make sure to import the required packaged from requirements.txt.
