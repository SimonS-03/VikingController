# VikingController
Contains the code for our (team SwedishVikings) AI agent submission in the 2025 Explainable Fuzzy Challenge.

The controller is contained within the files RunOrShootController.py or RunOrShootControllerEXPLANATIONS.py to play with or without explanations. Make sure to have the source code kessler-game-main folder installed (from kessler game public repository) and have it next to the VikingAgent folder in your files.
